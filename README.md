# Q-UP

Q-UP is a mobile web application that aims to simplify and improve the waitlist
experience for restaurants and their guests.

## Description

The application allows diners to view estimated wait times at area restaurants
based on their party size, and allows them to join a chosen waitlist remotely
without first having to visit the restaurant host stand. Guests will then
receive an app notification when their table is ready. In addition to waitlist
management, Q-UP also provides restaurants with a simple option for table
management at significantly lower cost than traditional pager systems. The app
also helps reduce empty seats by pairing parties with the most appropriately
sized table.
